# Curricular Analytics Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts used for UCSD's [Curricular Analytics](https://github.com/SheepTester-forks/curricular-analytics-exploration) project. These are usually used to organize new files into the formatting for Curricular Analytics, and are only used one time to create a new file that will then be used directly.

## Files

- **metrics_format.ipynb**: Used to fit new 2025 metrics files into the given overall metrics CSV format. Combined metrics from multiple files to create one overall file.
